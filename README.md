Advent Of Code solutions

Currently only solved year 2023, using both python and rust. 

To run, check the main files in 2023 in each languages directory.
Run them and pass either "dayXX" as an argument or "main" to run all of them.
Within the main files there are three config flags which are relevant when running a single day. Use `VERSION` to select part 1 or 2 and `USE_SAMPLE` to choose between sample or real input. Set `ALL` to true to run through all 4 results of that day.
